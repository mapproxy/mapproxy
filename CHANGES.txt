0.8.4 2010-08-01

- Extra newline at the end of all templates. Some deployment setups
  removed the last characters.
- Improved PNG performance with PIL fastpng branch.
- New concurrent_requests option to limit requests for each source WMS server.

0.8.3 2010-06-01

- Some bug fixes regarding feature info
- The configured resolutions are sorted

0.8.3rc2 2010-05-25

- HTTPS support with certificate verification and HTTP Basic-
  Authentication.
- New `use_direct_from_level` and `use_direct_from_res` options to
  disable caching for high resolutions.
- New `cache_tiles` source for more flexible tile-based sources
  Supports url templates like '/tiles?x=%(x)s&y=%(y)s&level=%(z)s'
  and Quadkeys as used by Bing-Maps. (as suggested by Pascal)
- You can limit the SRS of a source WMS with the `supported_srs`
  option. MapProxy will reproject between cached/requested SRS and
  the supported. This also works with direct layers, i.e. you can
  reproject WMS on-the-fly.

0.8.3rc1 2010-04-30

- new improved seed tool
  
  - seed polygon areas instead BBOX (from shapefiles, etc)
  - advanced seeding strategy
  - multiprocessing

- new link_single_color_images layer option. multiple "empty" tiles will
  be linked to the same image. (Unix only)
- fixed transparency for image parts without tiles
- log HTTP requests to servers regardless of the success
- made proj4 data dir configurable
- use same ordering of layers in service.yaml for capabilities documents
  (use list of dicts in configuration, see docs)
- performance improvements for requests with multiple layers and
  for layers with smaler BBOXs
