Making a new MapProxy release
=============================

Preparation
-----------

You will need wheel and twine to build and upload a new release:

    pip install wheel twine



- Update CHANGES.txt with all important changes. Verify version and date in header line.
- Update version in `setup.py` and `doc/conf.py`.
- Commit updates changelog and version and tag the commit with (`git tag 1.12.0`).
- Push the new tag (`git push origin --tags`).


Build and upload
----------------

Build source tar.gz and wheel. (`egg_info -b "" -D` to remove date suffix from release version).

    python setup.py egg_info -b "" -D sdist
    python setup.py egg_info -b "" -D bdist_wheel


The new release can be uploaded to https://pypi.org/project/MapProxy/ with twine. You need an account on https://pypi.org and you need to be a collaborator for the MapProxy project.

    twine upload dist/MapProxy-1.12.0.tar.gz
    twine upload dist/MapProxy-1.12.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl

Be aware, you can only upload a file once. If you made a mistake (e.g. files are missing in the tar.gz) then you will need to make a new release with an updated minor version.




Announce
--------


- Add a new blog article to mapproxy.org with the most important changes
