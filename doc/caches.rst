Caches
######

.. versionadded:: 1.2.0

MapProxy supports multiple backends to store the internal tiles. The default backend is file based and does not require any further configuration.


Configuration
=============

You can configure a backend for each cache with the ``cache`` option.
Each backend has a ``type`` and one or more options.

::

  caches:
    mycache:
      sources: [...]
      grids: [...]
      cache:
        type: backendtype
        backendoption1: value
        backendoption2: value


The following backend types are available.


- :ref:`cache_file`
- :ref:`cache_mbtiles`
- :ref:`cache_sqlite`
- :ref:`cache_geopackage`
- :ref:`cache_couchdb`
- :ref:`cache_riak`
- :ref:`cache_s3`
- :ref:`cache_compact`

.. _cache_file:

``file``
========

This is the default cache type and it uses a single file for each tile. Available options are:

``directory_layout``:
  The directory layout MapProxy uses to store tiles on disk. Defaults to ``tc`` which uses a TileCache compatible directory layout (``zz/xxx/xxx/xxx/yyy/yyy/yyy.format``). ``mp`` uses a directory layout with less nesting (``zz/xxxx/xxxx/yyyy/yyyy.format```). ``tms`` uses TMS compatible directories (``zz/xxxx/yyyy.format``). ``quadkey`` uses Microsoft Virtual Earth or quadkey compatible directories (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259689.aspx). ``arcgis`` uses a directory layout with hexadecimal row and column numbers that is compatible to ArcGIS exploded caches (``Lzz/Rxxxxxxxx/Cyyyyyyyy.format``).

  .. note::
    ``tms``, ``quadkey`` and ``arcgis`` layout are not suited for large caches, since it will create directories with thousands of files, which most file systems do not handle well.

``use_grid_names``:
  When ``true`` MapProxy will use the actual grid name in the path instead of the SRS code. E.g. tiles will be stored in ``./cache_data/mylayer/mygrid/`` instead of ``./cache_data/mylayer/EPSG1234/``.

  .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

.. _cache_file_directory:

``directory``:
  Directory where MapProxy should directly store the tiles. This will not add the cache name or grid name (``use_grid_name``) to the path. You can use this option to point MapProxy to an existing tile collection (created with ``gdal2tiles`` for example).

  .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

``tile_lock_dir``:
  Directory where MapProxy should write lock files when it creates new tiles for this cache. Defaults to ``cache_data/tile_locks``.

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

.. _cache_mbtiles:

``mbtiles``
===========

Use a single SQLite file for this cache. It uses the `MBTile specification <http://mbtiles.org/>`_.

Available options:

``filename``:
  The path to the MBTiles file. Defaults to ``cachename.mbtiles``.

``tile_lock_dir``:
  Directory where MapProxy should write lock files when it creates new tiles for this cache. Defaults to ``cache_data/tile_locks``.

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.0


You can set the ``sources`` to an empty list, if you use an existing MBTiles file and do not have a source.

::

  caches:
    mbtiles_cache:
      sources: []
      grids: [GLOBAL_MERCATOR]
      cache:
        type: mbtiles
        filename: /path/to/bluemarble.mbtiles

.. note::

  The MBTiles format specification does not include any timestamps for each tile and the seeding function is limited therefore. If you include any ``refresh_before`` time in a seed task, all tiles will be recreated regardless of the value. The cleanup process does not support any ``remove_before`` times for MBTiles and it always removes all tiles.
  Use the ``--summary`` option of the ``mapproxy-seed`` tool.

The note about ``bulk_meta_tiles`` for SQLite below applies to MBtiles as well.

.. _cache_sqlite:

``sqlite``
===========

.. versionadded:: 1.6.0

Use SQLite databases to store the tiles, similar to ``mbtiles`` cache. The difference to ``mbtiles`` cache is that the ``sqlite`` cache stores each level into a separate database. This makes it easy to remove complete levels during mapproxy-seed cleanup processes. The ``sqlite`` cache also stores the timestamp of each tile.

Available options:

``dirname``:
  The directory where the level databases will be stored.

``tile_lock_dir``:
  Directory where MapProxy should write lock files when it creates new tiles for this cache. Defaults to ``cache_data/tile_locks``.

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

::

  caches:
    sqlite_cache:
      sources: [mywms]
      grids: [GLOBAL_MERCATOR]
      cache:
        type: sqlite
        directory: /path/to/cache


.. note::

  .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

  All tiles from a meta tile request are stored in one transaction into the SQLite file to increase performance. You need to activate the :ref:`bulk_meta_tiles <bulk_meta_tiles>` option to get the same benefit when you are using tiled sources.

  ::

    caches:
      sqlite_cache:
        sources: [mytilesource]
        bulk_meta_tiles: true
        grids: [GLOBAL_MERCATOR]
        cache:
          type: sqlite
          directory: /path/to/cache

.. _cache_couchdb:

``couchdb``
===========

.. versionadded:: 1.3.0

Store tiles inside a `CouchDB <http://couchdb.apache.org/>`_. MapProxy creates a JSON document for each tile. This document contains metadata, like timestamps, and the tile image itself as a attachment.


Requirements
------------

Besides a running CouchDB you will need the `Python requests package <http://python-requests.org/>`_. You can install it the usual way, for example ``pip install requests``.

Configuration
-------------

You can configure the database and database name and the tile ID and additional metadata.

Available options:

``url``:
  The URL of the CouchDB server. Defaults to ``http://localhost:5984``.

``db_name``:
  The name of the database MapProxy uses for this cache. Defaults to the name of the cache.

``tile_lock_dir``:
  Directory where MapProxy should write lock files when it creates new tiles for this cache. Defaults to ``cache_data/tile_locks``.

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

``tile_id``:
  Each tile document needs a unique ID. You can change the format with a Python format string that expects the following keys:

  ``x``, ``y``, ``z``:
    The tile coordinate.

  ``grid_name``:
    The name of the grid.

  The default ID uses the following format::

    %(grid_name)s-%(z)d-%(x)d-%(y)d

  .. note:: You can't use slashes (``/``) in CouchDB IDs.

``tile_metadata``:
  MapProxy stores a JSON document for each tile in CouchDB and you can add additional key-value pairs  with metadata to each document.
  There are a few predefined values that MapProxy will replace with  tile-depended values, all other values will be added as they are.

  Predefined values:

  ``{{x}}``, ``{{y}}``, ``{{z}}``:
    The tile coordinate.

  ``{{timestamp}}``:
    The creation time of the tile as seconds since epoch. MapProxy will add a ``timestamp`` key for you, if you don't provide a custom timestamp key.

  ``{{utc_iso}}``:
    The creation time of the tile in UTC in ISO format. For example: ``2011-12-31T23:59:59Z``.

  ``{{tile_centroid}}``:
    The center coordinate of the tile in the cache's coordinate system as a list of long/lat or x/y values.

  ``{{wgs_tile_centroid}}``:
    The center coordinate of the tile in WGS 84 as a list of long/lat values.

Example
-------

::

  caches:
    mycouchdbcache:
      sources: [mywms]
      grids: [mygrid]
      cache:
        type: couchdb
        url: http://localhost:9999
        db_name: mywms_tiles
        tile_metadata:
          mydata: myvalue
          tile_col: '{{x}}'
          tile_row: '{{y}}'
          tile_level: '{{z}}'
          created_ts: '{{timestamp}}'
          created: '{{utc_iso}}'
          center: '{{wgs_tile_centroid}}'



MapProxy will place the JSON document for tile z=3, x=1, y=2 at ``http://localhost:9999/mywms_tiles/mygrid-3-1-2``. The document will look like::

  {
      "_attachments": {
          "tile": {
              "content_type": "image/png",
              "digest": "md5-ch4j5Piov6a5FlAZtwPVhQ==",
              "length": 921,
              "revpos": 2,
              "stub": true
          }
      },
      "_id": "mygrid-3-1-2",
      "_rev": "2-9932acafd060e10bc0db23231574f933",
      "center": [
          -112.5,
          -55.7765730186677
      ],
      "created": "2011-12-15T12:56:21Z",
      "created_ts": 1323953781.531889,
      "mydata": "myvalue",
      "tile_col": 1,
      "tile_level": 3,
      "tile_row": 2
  }


The ``_attachments``-part is the internal structure of CouchDB where the tile itself is stored. You can access the tile directly at: ``http://localhost:9999/mywms_tiles/mygrid-3-1-2/tile``.

.. _cache_riak:

``riak``
========

.. versionadded:: 1.6.0

Store tiles in a `Riak <http://basho.com/riak/>`_ cluster. MapProxy creates keys with binary data as value and timestamps as user defined metadata.
This backend is good for very large caches which can be distributed over many nodes. Data can be distributed over multiple nodes providing a fault-tolernt and high-available storage. A Riak cluster is masterless and each node can handle read and write requests.

Requirements
------------

You will need the `Python Riak client <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/riak>`_ version 2.0 or newer. You can install it in the usual way, for example with ``pip install riak``. Environments with older version must be upgraded with ``pip install -U riak``.

Configuration
-------------

Available options:

``nodes``:
    A list of riak nodes. Each node needs a ``host`` and optionally a ``pb_port`` and an ``http_port`` if the ports differ from the default. A single localhost node is used if you don't configure any nodes.

``protocol``:
    Communication protocol. Allowed options is ``http``, ``https`` and ``pbc``. Defaults to ``pbc``.

``bucket``:
    The name of the bucket MapProxy uses for this cache. The bucket is the namespace for the tiles and needs to be unique for each cache. Defaults to cache name suffixed with grid name (e.g. ``mycache_webmercator``).

``default_ports``:
    Default ``pb`` and ``http`` ports for ``pbc`` and ``http`` protocols. Will be used as the default for each defined node.

``secondary_index``:
    If ``true`` enables secondary index for tiles. This improves seed cleanup performance but requires that Riak uses LevelDB as the backend. Refer to the Riak documentation. Defaults to ``false``.

Example
-------

::

    myriakcache:
        sources: [mywms]
        grids: [mygrid]
        type: riak
        nodes:
            - host: 1.example.org
              pb_port: 9999
            - host: 1.example.org
            - host: 1.example.org
        protocol: pbc
        bucket: myriakcachetiles
        default_ports:
            pb: 8087
            http: 8098


.. _cache_geopackage:

``geopackage``
==============

.. versionadded:: 1.10.0

Store tiles in a `geopackage <http://www.geopackage.org/>`_ database. MapProxy creates a tile table if one isn't defined and populates the required meta data fields.
This backend is good for datasets that require portability.
Available options:

``filename``:
  The path to the geopackage file. Defaults to ``cachename.gpkg``.

``table_name``:
  The name of the table where the tiles should be stored (or retrieved if using an existing cache). Defaults to the ``cachename_gridname``.

``levels``:
  Set this to true to cache to a directory where each level is stored in a separate geopackage. Defaults to ``false``.
  If set to true, ``filename`` is ignored.

``directory``:
  If levels is true use this to specify the directory to store geopackage files.

You can set the ``sources`` to an empty list, if you use an existing geopackage file and do not have a source.

::

  caches:
    geopackage_cache:
      sources: []
      grids: [GLOBAL_MERCATOR]
      cache:
        type: geopackage
        filename: /path/to/bluemarble.gpkg
        table_name: bluemarble_tiles

.. note::

  The geopackage format specification does not include any timestamps for each tile and the seeding function is limited therefore. If you include any ``refresh_before`` time in a seed task, all tiles will be recreated regardless of the value. The cleanup process does not support any ``remove_before`` times for geopackage and it always removes all tiles.
  Use the ``--summary`` option of the ``mapproxy-seed`` tool.


.. _cache_s3:

``s3``
======

.. versionadded:: 1.10.0

Store tiles in a `Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`_.


Requirements
------------

You will need the Python `boto3 <https://github.com/boto/boto3>`_ package. You can install it in the usual way, for example with ``pip install boto3``.

Configuration
-------------

Available options:

``bucket_name``:
  The bucket used for this cache. You can set the default bucket with ``globals.cache.s3.bucket_name``.

``profile_name``:
  Optional profile name for `shared credentials <http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/configuration.html>`_ for this cache. Alternative methods of authentification are using the  ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` environmental variables, or by using an `IAM role <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html>`_ when using an Amazon EC2 instance.
  You can set the default profile with ``globals.cache.s3.profile_name``.

``directory``:
  Base directory (path) where all tiles are stored.

``directory_layout``:
  Defines the directory layout for the tiles (``12/12345/67890.png``, ``L12/R00010932/C00003039.png``, etc.).  See :ref:`cache_file` for available options. Defaults to ``tms`` (e.g. ``12/12345/67890.png``). This cache cache also supports ``reverse_tms`` where tiles are stored as ``y/x/z.format``. See *note* below.

.. note::
  The hierarchical ``directory_layouts`` can hit limitations of S3 *"if you are routinely processing 100 or more requests per second"*. ``directory_layout: reverse_tms`` can work around this limitation. Please read `S3 Request Rate and Performance Considerations <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/request-rate-perf-considerations.html>`_ for more information on this issue.

Example
-------

::

  cache:
    my_layer_20110501_epsg_4326_cache_out:
      sources: [my_layer_20110501_cache]
      cache:
        type: s3
        directory: /1.0.0/my_layer/default/20110501/4326/
        bucket_name: my-s3-tiles-cache

  globals:
    cache:
      s3:
        profile_name: default


.. _cache_compact:


``compact``
===========

.. versionadded:: 1.10.0

Store tiles in ArcGIS compatible compact cache files. A single compact cache ``.bundle`` file stores up to about 16,000 tiles. There is one additional ``.bundlx`` index file for each ``.bundle`` data file.

Only version 1 of the compact cache format (ArcGIS 10.0-10.2) is supported. Version 2 (ArcGIS 10.3 or higher) is not supported at the moment.

Available options:

``directory``:
  Directory where MapProxy should store the level directories. This will not add the cache name or grid name to the path. You can use this option to point MapProxy to an existing compact cache.

``version``:
  The version of the ArcGIS compact cache format. This option is required.


You can set the ``sources`` to an empty list, if you use an existing compact cache files and do not have a source.


The following configuration will load tiles from ``/path/to/cache/L00/R0000C0000.bundle``, etc.

::

  caches:
    compact_cache:
      sources: []
      grids: [webmercator]
      cache:
        type: compact
        version: 1
        directory: /path/to/cache

.. note::

  The compact cache format does not include any timestamps for each tile and the seeding function is limited therefore. If you include any ``refresh_before`` time in a seed task, all tiles will be recreated regardless of the value. The cleanup process does not support any ``remove_before`` times for compact caches and it always removes all tiles.
  Use the ``--summary`` option of the ``mapproxy-seed`` tool.


.. note::

  The compact cache format is append-only to allow parallel read and write operations. Removing or refreshing tiles with ``mapproxy-seed`` does not reduce the size of the cache files. Therefore, this format is not suitable for caches that require frequent updates.
